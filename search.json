    "text": "You might be wondering: why brown algae?\nI find them super interesting due to one key fact: they evolved complex multicellularity independently of animals, plants, fungi and red algae.\nAs such, these organisms give a unique lens into the principles of development and evolution of multicellularity."

    "text": "From the diverse life forms we observe on Earth, a question often arises: what generates this biodiversity?\nMy curiosity lies on the other side of the coin: what limits biodiversity?\nOne factor is the process of development that creates these organisms in the first place. But exactly how - and are findings in model systems generally shared across Earth’s diverse life forms?\nAs a doctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Biology (Tübingen, Germany), I seek answers to these biological questions through bioinformatics research using brown algae as a model system."
