I was born in Kagoshima (Japan), grew up in Bangkok (Thailand) and studied in London (BSc. in Biological Sciences from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/)), Cambridge (MPhil in Zooology from [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/)). I am now based in southern Germany at the [Max Planck Institute for Biology](www.bio.mpg.de) in TÃ¼bingen, working on my PhD in Bioinformatics.

PhD supervisors: Susana Coelho (director::[Department for Algal Development and Evolution](https://www.bio.mpg.de/48867/algal-development-and-evolution-s)) and Hajk-Georg Drost (group leader::[Computational Biology Group](https://drostlab.com/), now associate professor in Dundee).

Aside from my direct research projects, I am generally interested in bioinformatics, developmental biology and informations-thinking in biology.
