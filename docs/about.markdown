> Limited forms most beautiful

From the diverse life forms we observe on Earth, a question often arises: what factors generate biodiversity?
My curiosity lies on the other side of the coin: what factors **limit** biodiversity? One factor is the process of development that creates these organisms in the first place. But exactly how? And how general are findings in model systems shared across Earth's diverse life forms (especially those that evolved multicellularity independently)?

Since my wet-lab skills are not so advanced, I have decided to explore these questions on a computer. 

I am grateful to Susana Coelho who directs the [Dept. Algal Development and Evolution](https://www.bio.mpg.de/48867/algal-development-and-evolution-s) at the [MPI for Biology](https://www.bio.mpg.de/) for hosting me as a PhD candidate in Bioinformatics to explore these fundamental biological questions in brown algae, which evolved complex multicellularity independently from animals, plants and fungi. I also thank Hajk-Georg Drost who leads the [Computational Biology Group](https://drostlab.com/) for technical expertise and the opportunity to contribute to open source projects. Aside from research, I am also generally interested in developmental biology, bioinformatics and systems-thinking in biology.
