Hi! My name is Jaruwatana Sōdai Lotharukpong (จารุวัฒนา 壮大 โลทารักษ์พงศ์). Like my ethnic background, my interests are a mishmash of various fields including: `developmental biology`, `systems biology`, and `bioinformatics`. I love how ideas from different traditions can together create wonderful and new concepts. This site is just about that!
